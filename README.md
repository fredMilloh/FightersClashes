# FightersClashes
RPG game model in macOS project, "Command Line Tool" template, 
interaction in the console with the readLine() method. 
Added a new target "Unit Testing Bundle", for some unit tests.

Game :
- each player chooses a name
- each player builds his team of 3 fighters
- each player chooses a fighter and gives a different name to each fighter

Fighter :
- the first player chooses a attacker from his team
- then an adversary in the opposite team
- he chooses the fight or give life points to his fighter
- the power of the weapon hurts the adversary (less life points)
- It's player 2's turn to choose a fighter, etc..
- Randomly a change of weapon can be proposed to the combatant playing his turn

Game over
- when all the fighters of a team have no more life, the game is over
- the winner is the team with at least one living fighter
